The goal is to form a _winning hand_ of 14 tiles. A standard winning hand
consists of four sets and one pair.

`c1|c2|c3` `b5|b5|b5` `m6|m7|m8` `w1|w3|w4` `d3|d3`

Bonus points will be awarded if each set is a pong or kong (_All Pongs_). There
are two other non-standard winning hands that give bonus points.

_Seven Pairs_ is achieved by forming seven pairs:

`c1|c1` `c2|c2` `b3|b3` `b4|b4` `m5|m5` `m7|m7` `w2|w2`

_Chaotic Thirteen_ is achieved by forming 14 distinct tiles, such that no two
numerical tiles can be completed into a sequence:

`c1` `c4` `c7` `b2` `b5` `b8` `m3` `m6` `m9` `w1` `w4` `d1` `d2` `d3`

In this case, bonus points will be awarded if all seven honor tiles are present
(_Seven Stars_).
