Two identical tiles are called a _pair_:

`c6|c6` `w1|w1` `d1|d1`

A _pong_ is a set of three identical tiles:

`b5|b5|b5` `w2|w2|w2` `d2|d2|d2`

A _kong_ is a set of four identical tiles:

`m9|m9|m9|m9` `d1|d1|d1|d1`

A _sequence_ is a set of three consecutive same-suited tiles:

`c1|c2|c3` `b4|b5|b6` `m7|m8|m9`

For honor tiles, any three distinct same-suited tiles can form a sequence:

`w1|w2|w4` `d1|d2|d3`

A _set_ is either a pong, a kong, or a sequence.
