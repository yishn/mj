There are three _numerical suits_ and two non-numerical suits, so-called _honor
suits_. The numerical tiles range from one to nine:

|         |                  |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Circles | `c1` `c2` … `c9` |
| Bamboo  | `b1` `b2` … `b9` |
| Myriads | `m1` `m2` … `m9` |

There are two honor suits, ordered as follows:

|         |                     |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Winds   | `w1` `w2` `w3` `w4` |
| Dragons | `d1` `d2` `d3`      |

There are four copies of each of the tiles.
