At the start, every player gets 13 tiles and a _joker indicator tile_ is drawn.
The other three identical tiles and the four tiles that come after in suit order
will become _jokers_ and will glow. A joker can be substituted for any tile in a
winning hand.

`m9*` `m1*`

On a playerâ€™s turn, they will first draw a tile. They can then proceed to
declare a win if they have a winning hand, or discard any tile.

Once a tile is discarded, all the other players can react and _steal_ the
discard by forming a pong, kong, or winning hand with it. If someone does, the
player who reacted needs to reveal his completed set and the turn continues to
them.

If no one reacts, the turn continues to the next player, who then has the
ability to either _eat_ the discard by selecting two of their own tiles to form
a set, or to draw a new tile.
