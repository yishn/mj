      At the start, every player gets 13 tiles and a{" "}
      <em>joker indicator tile</em> is drawn. The tiles identical to the drawn
      tile and the one that comes after in suit order will become{" "}
      <em>jokers</em> and will glow. A joker can be substituted for any tile in
      a winning hand.

      On a playerâ€™s turn, the player will first draw <DrawIcon /> a tile. They
      can then proceed to declare a win <WinIcon /> if they have a winning hand,
      or discard <DiscardIcon /> any tile on their hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a tile is discarded, all the other players can react and
      <em>steal</em> the discard by forming a pong <PongIcon />, a kong
      <KongIcon />, or a winning hand <WinIcon /> with it. If someone does, the
      player who reacted reveals his completed set and the turn continues to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no one reacts, the turn continues to the next player, who then has the
      ability to either <em>eat</em> <EatIcon /> the discard by selecting two of
      their own tiles to form a sequence or other set, or to draw a new tile.
